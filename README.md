# WheelOfFortune

Genesis 10, Dev 10, Week 6, Wheel of Fortune Assesment

The plans folder houses my pseudocode and overarching plan for the creation of my project. The main project can be found in Wheel of Fortune.py. 

The wheel of fortune python file runs a variation on a wheel of fortune game with 3 players playing 2 normal rounds and a 3rd round being played by the player with the most money after the 2 normal rounds.

Simply download and run the python file to give the game a go!
